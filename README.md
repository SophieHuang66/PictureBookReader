# PictureBookReader for Android
This is a experimental project designed for non-profit educational purpose by request of a public library. 
We build this App for free and since this project is based on Readium it's under the same license (open source software) thus we share our code via Github.
The differences between this project and Readium's sample launcher:
1. Application communicates with a content management system, so the book list is dynamic (fetched from server).
2. Readers can download the epub files they desire from the above list (we implemented the download handling part).
3. Application is designed to show fixed layout epub containing only pictures, no TOC/bookmark/highlight/setting functions are provided.
Code might be a little bit messy since it's an "experiment". This is my first Android App so I'm sorry for parts that are not very well organized. :)
